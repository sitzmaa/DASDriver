# DASDriver
Code from my DAS driver, built both in Windows and NetBSD

## Overview

This project was carried out by one other person and I.

We were tasked with building a driver for a digital analog converter chip using the PCI bus. The project had little direction and we gained most of our understanding of the process by reading technical manuals and Windows driver development pages. Both the NetBSD build and Windows build were created completely from scratch
